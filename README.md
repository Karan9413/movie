# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A **content-based Movie Recommendation System** built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**. The application recommends movies similar to a selected title by analyzing textual features such as genres, keywords, cast, and movie overviews.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🎯 Select a movie from a dropdown menu.
* 🎬 Get the **Top 5** similar movie recommendations.
* 🧠 Content-based filtering using **Cosine Similarity**.
* ⚡ Fast and interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
* 📊 Powered by the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The recommendation system follows these steps:

1. Load the TMDB movie and credits datasets.
2. Combine important textual features such as:

   * Genres
   * Keywords
   * Cast
   * Overview
3. Convert the combined text into numerical vectors using **CountVectorizer** or **TF-IDF Vectorizer**.
4. Calculate the similarity between movies using **Cosine Similarity**.
5. When a movie is selected, return the **Top 5** most similar movies.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karan9413/movie.git
cd movie
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

**Windows**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Generate the model files

Run the notebook to generate the required files:

```text
movie_recommendation.ipynb
```

This creates:

* `movies.pkl`
* `similarity.pkl`

### 5. Run the application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
